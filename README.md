# Pre-requisites
-----------------
1. Deploy the matter most app which is very similar to slack in `herokuapp`
Example: https://mattermost<>.herokuapp.com/
2. Download ngork and generate the url. Example: http://a0ba5078660e.ngrok.io
3. In the mattermost integration - Slash command  page enter the `reqest_url` as http://a0ba5078660e.ngrok.io/jira
`/jira` should be present so that the backend recognises the input request from mattermost to backend
4.Create Slash command `jira` with the method as `POST` and select the `request url` as 
http://a0ba5078660e.ngrok.io/jira

# Usage
-----------------
1. Run the **MatterMostSlashJiraIntegration** Spring boot application in a embedded tomcat web server in the port 8080 which is been forwarded to temporary url to the outside world generated by ngoirk
2. Type the slash command from **mattermost** which is been deployed in herokuapp

** Result:** 
-----------
For now:
The backend responds 
":wave: Need some help with `/jira`?\n" +"Use `/jira` to lookup a jira ticket.  e.g. /jira PROJECT-123"
   

[WIP] 
** Phase 2 **
Back end should respond information about the enquired Jira ticket
